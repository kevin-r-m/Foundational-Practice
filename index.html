        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I started this project to help myself stay fresh with foundational web dev languages. I have spent a lot of time recently focusing on frameworks and while much of the syntax, structuring, and functionality carries through to those frameworks, I felt I was not as sharp as I once was. So, this was put together to be a zone for baseline everything.</p>
